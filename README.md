# Mapping
_the act or process of making a map_

A utility for drawing GeoJSON and TopoJSON as SVG

A 10k Apart Project that creates maps from geogaphic data (supports GeoJSON and TopoJSON). Map is rendered using Mercator projection, in less than 10k of code, and supports progressive enhancement (still works without client-side JavaScript via Node). Uses pieces of [D3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) and [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson).

## Usage
Run **node map.js** and go to **http://localhost:8080/** in your browser
